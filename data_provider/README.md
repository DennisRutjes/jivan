This package is primarily an interface between the wfs3 data collection functions in `wfs3/`
and the tegola data providers.

While it adds some additional functionality such as filtering based on properties or time
parameters not supported by the tegola data providers, the aim is for that functionality
to be pushed into the provider for efficiency gains & to make the tegola providers more useful
generally as a package.
